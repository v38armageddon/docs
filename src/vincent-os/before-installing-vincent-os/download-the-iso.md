## Versioning scheme
Vincent OS use the following versioning scheme: `MAJOR.minor`
- `MAJOR`: Significant changes, new features, or major improvements. These releases introduce new functionalities and support the normal Vincent OS lifecycle.
- `minor`: Minor updates, bug fixes, and security patches. These releases focus on maintaining stability and addressing issues without introducing significant changes.

When a new `minor` version is released, it will replace the previous `minor` version within the same `MAJOR` version. For example, if version `1.0` is released and later updated to `1.1`, the `1.1` version will supersede `1.0`.
