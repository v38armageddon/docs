# Installation
The installation of Vincent OS is a simple process that can be completed in a few steps. Follow the instructions below to get started:

## Step 1: Prepare Installation Media
To install Vincent OS, you will need to create a Vincent OS LiveCD, you can refer to the following documentation:
- [Flash the ISO](../before-installing-vincent-os/flash-the-iso.md)

## Step 2: Boot from LiveCD
### Change Boot Order
Once you have created the LiveCD, insert it into your computer and reboot. 

You may need to change the boot order in your BIOS/UEFI settings to boot from the USB Stick first.

### Boot from LiveCD
When the system starts, you should see the Vincent OS boot menu. Select the following option: ``Vincent OS LiveCD``.

If you saw the login desktop, you have successfully booted into the LiveCD environment!

The default login credentials are as follows:
- Username: **user**
- Password: **VincentOS**

You are now logged into the Vincent OS LiveCD environment. From here, you can begin the [installation process](installation-steps.md).
